A journal (through French from Latin diurnalis, daily) has several related meanings:

a daily record of events or business; a private journal is usually referred to as a diary
a newspaper or other periodical, in the literal sense of one published each day
many publications issued at stated intervals, such as academic journals (including scientific journals), or the record of the transactions of a society, are often called journals.[1] In academic use, a journal refers to a serious, scholarly publication that is peer-reviewed. A non-scholarly magazine written for an educated audience about an industry or an area of professional activity is usually called a trade magazine.
